.. description: Setting up a SparcServer5 system and a Wyse30 Terminal with OpenBSD.
.. type: text

I found an old Sun Microsystems SparcServer5 the other day when helping my parent clean out their shed.  Connect to this
a Wyse30 terminal that I had picked up, install OpenBSD and Python, connect it to the network, and enjoy a shiny old
home automation interface.
