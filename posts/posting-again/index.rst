.. description: Posting Again... and created a input board for old radios.
.. type: text

I'm posting again after a long while.  I'm not terribly good about updating this website, but I'll hopefully get better.
This long overdue post was spawned due to a recent creating of a couple of repositories on GitHub.  These two
repositories are https://github.com/dwilliams/ole-radio-input-switch and https://github.com/dwilliams/pcb-things.

.. TEASER_END

.. -- Talk a bit about the ole radio switch

The first repo (https://github.com/dwilliams/ole-radio-input-switch) contains a project to provide an input for the old
radios that I'm restoring.  I would like to be able to use these radios for audio books or soft music around the house.
I'm not a fan of the butchering that happens to these radios when people replace the old tube guts with an iPood or
raspberry pi media player and cheap chinese amplifier.  I've designed a couple of small boards that can be inserted into
an old radio between the detector section and the amplifier or output section (which is usually where a volume control
exists) that will allow a line input or bluetooth module to be switched in.  This adds an input while keeping the
original radio circuitry intact and functional.

Here's some pictures of these boards:

.. -- Talk a bit about the pcb things

The second repo (https://github.com/dwilliams/pcb-things) contains random printed circuit board designs that don't fit
into other projects.  The first couple of PCBs that have been added are a couple of panels for holding a tube socket and
banana jacks for each pin.  Originally, I priced out the 4 inch square panel as an aluminium panel through Front Panel
Express.  It was about 40$ per panel, which isn't a bad price for custom milling.  However, I have just been making a
couple of PCBs for the above project and saw that ten 4 inch PCBs could be purchased for 5$ plus shipping.  That price
difference made it worth using PCBs instead of aluminium for these panels, which will be bench top experiment devices.
