.. description: Modifying a Yaesu VX-3R radio for use with the DEF CON repeater.
.. type: text

I'm sitting here in Las Vegas waiting for a friend to finish his booth duty at BlackHat.  A number of groups here at
DEF CON have radio repeaters setup in the 70 cm and the General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) / Family Radio Service
(FRS) bands.  While I have little to do, I figured I'd turn my Yaesu VX-3R into an "experimental" radio and unlock the
ability to transmit in the GMRS / FRS bands.

.. TEASER_END

.. -- Talk a bit about the potential legality and explain that I'm staying within the power limits of the bands.  Also
.. --   mention that the FCC has provisions for experimental and homebrew equipments (which includes one-off
.. --   modifications to production models)

.. -- Show and explain the pictures of the modifications.

This is a very simple modification that was made even simpler by failing to use what I thought would be the correct
tools.  These photos are of my making the modification in a hotel room in Las Vegas before DEF CON.  The most
complicated part of the process is removing the little resistor buried deep in the radio after removing the protective
sticker.

.. -- Get a new picture of transmitting on FRS in low power mode.

And here's the final picture with a quick squirt on an FRS Channel at about 0.1 W just to make sure the radio no
longer displays error when attempting to transmit.
